# ðŸ“˜ Real-Time Uber Trips Project â€“ Technical Summary

This project simulates real-time data ingestion, transformation, and monitoring using Microsoft Fabric's modern data stack including Eventstream, Lakehouse, KQL, and Power BI.

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)

- **Source Data**: 6 CSV files (3 for fare, 3 for trip data) were zipped and uploaded to Google Drive.
- **Extraction**: The ZIP was downloaded and extracted within a notebook.
- **Streaming**: Data was sent in batches from the notebook to **Microsoft Fabric Eventstream** to simulate real-time flow.
- **Batch Handling**: Due to large file sizes, the data was chunked and a sleep interval was added between batch sends to avoid overload.
- **Bronze Storage**: The raw data was written to the Lakehouse in Delta format as the Bronze layer.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Data Cleaning & Transformation (Silver Layer)

### âœ… Trip Data Transformations

- Converted `pickup_datetime` and `dropoff_datetime` to timestamp.
- Casted `store_and_fwd_flag` to Boolean (`Y` â†’ `True`, others â†’ `False`).
- Casted `medallion` and `hack_license` to String.
- Filtered out rows with non-positive values in `passenger_count`, `trip_time_in_secs`, or `trip_distance`.
- `rate_code`: Invalid values (not 1â€“6) were marked as `None`; then cast to `ByteType`.
- Casted `passenger_count` to `ShortType`.
- Checked duplicates on combination of `medallion`, `hack_license`, `pickup_datetime`.
- Validated coordinates and removed extreme/zero values.
- Applied **IQR outlier analysis** on numeric columns.
- Created a `trip_id` column via SHA2 hash of `medallion + hack_license + pickup_datetime`.
- Extracted `month` from `pickup_datetime` for partitioning.
- Saved to `silver.silver_uber_trip` with `partitionBy("month")` in Delta format.

---

### âœ… Fare Data Transformations

- Read from `bronze_uber_fare`.
- Dropped unneeded columns: `EventProcessedUtcTime`, `PartitionId`, `EventEnqueuedUtcTime`.
- Converted data types (`string`, `float`, `timestamp`).
- Converted `pickup_datetime` to timestamp.
- Translated `payment_type` to numeric codes.
- Flagged tip anomalies â†’ `is_tip_anomaly` column.
- Recalculated `total_amount` and replaced the original value.
- Dropped `calculated_total`, `total_mismatch`.
- Removed `has_negative_values` if no `True` values existed.
- Created `trip_id` (same logic as trip data).
- Applied IQR analysis for outliers in `fare_amount`, `tip_amount`, `total_amount`.
- Added outlier flags.
- Extracted `month` for partitioning.
- Saved to `silver.silver_uber_fare` with `partitionBy("month")`.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Data Modeling (Gold Layer)

- Created a **Dataflow** to merge trip and fare Silver tables into a **fact table**.
- Built **dimension tables** (e.g., vendor, zone, datetime) from the merged dataset.
- Modeled a **star schema** structure.
- Published the final model and tables to the **Warehouse** destination.

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Reporting & Real-Time Monitoring

- Used **Power BI (Fabric)** to build a live dashboard with metrics and visuals.
- Built a **semantic model** in Warehouse for Power BI.
- Configured **Eventhouse** and created a **KQL database** to query streaming data.
- Used KQL queries to drive the real-time dashboard.
- Set up **Activator** for rule-based alerts (e.g., "distance > 5 miles").
- Integrated alerts into the live dashboard for immediate visibility.
